# Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
This is a demo research project for standard NMF, HCNMF, and L2,1 NMF.

## Getting Started
This project aims to design and implement various innovative Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms, including the Standard NMF algorithm based on L2 norm, the L2,1 norm-based L2,1 NMF algorithm, and the HCNMF algorithm employing Armijo linear optimization strategy. These algorithms were applied to denoise image datasets containing different types of noise (Block, Salt & Pepper), leading to a significant improvement in the clarity and quality of the denoised images.
